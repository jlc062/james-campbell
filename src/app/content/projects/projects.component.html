                I started on this project as a fun way to brush up on my Javascript skills, and also create an application with Bootstrap from the ground up. I chose trivia as the focus point because during my time at college trivia came up frequently. My fraternity often utilized trivia as one of the events in our large philanthropy event called “Derby Days”. There was also always a trivia night at the local bar every Tuesday.
            </span>
            <span>
                With this in mind I wanted to make a quick and easy way of accessing trivia questions online. This site would be helpful for anyone who is hosting a trivia night, studying before a trivia event, or just looking to test their intelligence.
            </span>
            <span>
                I built this site using HTML, Javascript, CSS, and Bootstrap. I invoked the Open Trivia Database API to generate the trivia questions. This API allows some additional parameters to be passed, like an access token that prevents the same questions from showing up in repeated calls. On initialization of the page, I generate this access token by using a GET request with an XMLHttpRequest object. I then store this token in the users session storage to make sure they do not get the same questions. I plan on adding in an input for categories of questions so that users can narrow down the types of trivia questions that are generated.

            <span>
                I am currently working on a back-end for the application utilizing Node.js and MongoDB. With the intention of allowing users to save questions that they like to their profile.

            <span>With a team of four developers, we realized that most computerized chess 
                games left room for improvement with their graphical interface. 
                We decided to create our own version of a chess game that provided a more exciting user experience.

                Our team designed and implemented an MVC approach utilizing Java, 
                and adopted scrum methodologies in order to manage the workload and 
                complete in a timely manner. In addition to MVC, our team implemented networking 
                between computers utlizing Sockets in Java along with BufferedReader and BufferedWriter, in order 
                to send data about the moves made by players back and forth between the client and server.

        <div class="project-text-section">
            <span>
                In an algorithms class, with three other developers, we were tasked with 
                creating a spellcheck program. The goal of this being to reduce the program&rsquo;s 
                time complexity. We were told to use an algorithm, data structure, or a 
                combination of the two.
            </span>
            <span>
                Our team decided to create the program in C, and use a command line interface 
                on Linux to allow for user input. Originally we created a solution utilizing the 
                Longest Commmon Subsequence algorithm, to find the closest related word in a list 
                of given words to the mispelled one. This caused our runtime to be O(n*m).
            </span>
            <span>
                However after giving some thought to the best-case runtime, that in which 
                a word was spelled correctly and entered into our program. The best-case would be 
                O(n) time complexity, to iterate through our list of known words and check against the input. We sought to improve this 
                by creating a hast table in C so that the best-case runtime would be O(1).
            </span>
            <span>
                Our team was given a little over a week to complete this. Had we had more time 
                we all would have liked to utilize the hash table for all searches, rather than only correctly 
                spelled words. We would have liked to hash words into the table potentially based off it off ascii 
                values of letters, and modifying based off order of letters. 
                Then if a mispelled word was entered, we would use our hash function to generate the 
                hash value, check if this was in the hash table ( O(1) ), and if not find the closest value 
                in the hash table to it. Essentially running in at most O(n) for all words.

                For my senior design project, i was placed on a team of 3 developers and given a client who 
                had a coding project in mind. Our client tasked us with creating a user friendly way of 
                being able to get information on NBA players based on statistics. The client had wanted this 
                mainly for personal use.
            </span>
            <span>
                With these parameters in mind, we found an API online that could provide us with reliable NBA 
                statisctics information. We then wrote a Python script to call the api and save all of the data 
                returned into a CSV file. At which point we created a Python script to import this data into a SQLite database.
            </span>
            <span>
                We created the front-end of our application with Javascript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS. We handled 
                requests from the front-end with a Python server that would query the SQLite database based off form 
                data sent to the server in the HTTP request header. It would 
                then return a new HTML page to the client with results from the query.
            </span>
            <span>
                If I 
                had to redo the project knowing what I do now. I would have used a front-end framework like Angular 
                or React to make displaying dynamically loaded data from the database much easier. In addition, instead of 
                using Python and SQLite, I would have used .NET for the back-end so that we could host and scale 
                the server using Azure App Service. I also would have used Azure SQL Managed Instance to be able to scale the 
                database as well.
